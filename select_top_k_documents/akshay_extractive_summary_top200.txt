Final Summary
 its a threat to liberal democracy on a global scale, david kirkpatrick, author of the facebook effect, tells me in the latest edition of the politico money podcast, which dives into problems roiling the company including the disclosure that political consulting firm cambridge analytica, which had ties to donald trumps presidential campaign, accessed the private data of 50 million facebook users. and now, thanks to a whistleblower and two stunning reports in the observer and the new york times, we know that one of those developers siphoned data on more than 50 million facebook users and shared them with the trump campaigns voter targeting firm, cambridge analyticaa company that has bragged it has psychological profiles on 230 million american voters, which it uses to target people online with emotionally precise digital messaging to influence elections. share cambridge analytica, a data analysis firm that worked on president trump's 2016 campaign, and its related company, strategic communications laboratories, pilfered data on 50 million facebook users and secretly kept it, according to reports in the new york times, alongside the guardian and the observer. these statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between trump's campaign and the pac, although cambridge analytica has denied this.[59] canadian whistleblower christopher wylie who was the former director of research at cambridge analytica political scientists have been highly skeptical of claims made by cambridge analytica about the effectiveness of its microtargeting of voters (microtargeting refers to the process of "analyzing data to predict the behavior, interests, and opinions held by specific groups of people and then serving them the messages they're most likely to respond to").[60][15][16] political scientists note that access to digital data is not going to provide significantly more information than from public voter databases, and the digital data has limited value over time as the preferences of voters change.[15] political scientists also note that it is hard to infer political values from personality traits, which means that it is easy to mistarget the messages that are sent to voters with specific personality traits.[15] research discussed by brendan nyhan of dartmouth college showed that it is extremely hard to alter voters' preferences, because many likely voters are already committed partisans; as a result, it is easier to simply mobilize partisan voters.[61][15] tufts university political scientist eitan hersh, who has published on microtargeting in campaigns, has expressed strong skepticism about cambridge analytica's methods and their purported effectiveness, saying "every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [cambridge analytica] is bs."[62] in 2017, ca claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million us citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets.[63] in march 2017, the new york times reported that ca had exaggerated its capabilities: "cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the trump campaign."[12] trump aides have also disputed ca's role in the campaign, describing it as "modest" and noting that none of the company's efforts involved psychographics.[12] according to an aide and consultant for ted cruz's presidential campaign, their campaign stopped using ca after its psychographic models failed to identify likely cruz supporters. on friday night, as americans began settling into the weekend, facebook dropped a pretty substantial piece of news: the company said in a detailed blog post that it had suspended from its platform the political-data firm cambridge analytica, which worked with the trump campaign during the 2016 election, after learning the company hadnt deleted facebook user data it had obtained in violation of the social networks policies. over the weekend, the new york times and the observer of london posted a blockbuster investigative piece revealing that cambridge analytica, the firm brought on by the trump campaign to target voters online, used the data of tens of millions of people obtained from facebook without proper disclosures or permission. (steven senne/associated press) now that facebook, google and amazon know pretty much everything about us, how they're using that information is drawing the focus of politicians throughout the western world, asking in effect: "shouldn't something be done about this?" revelations that u.k.-based cambridge analytica apparently used data from more than 50 million facebook accounts to try to influence the 2016 u.s. presidential election in favour of donald trump have sparked criticism over how the giant social networking company protects its users' data. while at cambridge university, kogan formed a company in the u.k. called global science research, which created an app called 'thisisyourdigitallife' that offered facebook users personality predictions, in exchange for accessing their personal data on the social network and more limited information about their friends -- including their "likes" -- if their privacy settings allowed it.
