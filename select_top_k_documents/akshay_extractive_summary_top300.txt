'he needs to come testify before congress and explain how they're going to work with us to both protect privacy; there are 50 million facebook accounts that were used by this sketchy firm, cambridge analytica, and how we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again in terms of weaponization of these social media platforms.' emma kennedy tweeted that she had found that facebook had recorded 'every single phone number in my contacts zuckerberg's mea culpa comes after a terrible week for the social media giant, which saw its shares fall 13 percent to below $160 - the company's worst week in the stock market since july 2012. and now, thanks to a whistleblower and two stunning reports in the observer and the new york times, we know that one of those developers siphoned data on more than 50 million facebook users and shared them with the trump campaigns voter targeting firm, cambridge analyticaa company that has bragged it has psychological profiles on 230 million american voters, which it uses to target people online with emotionally precise digital messaging to influence elections. the demands came in response to news reports saturday about how the firm, cambridge analytica, used a feature once available to facebook app developers to collect information on 270,000 people and, in the process, gain access to data on tens of millions of their facebook friends  few, if any, of whom had given explicit permission for this sharing. it's the latest fallout from a controversy involving cambridge analytics, a company that reportedly bought data obtained by facebook and used it to create voter profiles which were then reportedly shared with the trump and pro-brexit campaigns 6:53 "recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns," privacy commissioner daniel therrien said in the statement. these statements potentially suggested unlawful coordination between trump's campaign and the pac, although cambridge analytica has denied this.[59] canadian whistleblower christopher wylie who was the former director of research at cambridge analytica political scientists have been highly skeptical of claims made by cambridge analytica about the effectiveness of its microtargeting of voters (microtargeting refers to the process of "analyzing data to predict the behavior, interests, and opinions held by specific groups of people and then serving them the messages they're most likely to respond to").[60][15][16] political scientists note that access to digital data is not going to provide significantly more information than from public voter databases, and the digital data has limited value over time as the preferences of voters change.[15] political scientists also note that it is hard to infer political values from personality traits, which means that it is easy to mistarget the messages that are sent to voters with specific personality traits.[15] research discussed by brendan nyhan of dartmouth college showed that it is extremely hard to alter voters' preferences, because many likely voters are already committed partisans; as a result, it is easier to simply mobilize partisan voters.[61][15] tufts university political scientist eitan hersh, who has published on microtargeting in campaigns, has expressed strong skepticism about cambridge analytica's methods and their purported effectiveness, saying "every claim about psychographics etc made by or about [cambridge analytica] is bs."[62] in 2017, ca claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million us citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets.[63] in march 2017, the new york times reported that ca had exaggerated its capabilities: "cambridge executives now concede that the company never used psychographics in the trump campaign."[12] trump aides have also disputed ca's role in the campaign, describing it as "modest" and noting that none of the company's efforts involved psychographics.[12] according to an aide and consultant for ted cruz's presidential campaign, their campaign stopped using ca after its psychographic models failed to identify likely cruz supporters. on friday night, as americans began settling into the weekend, facebook dropped a pretty substantial piece of news: the company said in a detailed blog post that it had suspended from its platform the political-data firm cambridge analytica, which worked with the trump campaign during the 2016 election, after learning the company hadnt deleted facebook user data it had obtained in violation of the social networks policies. to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of facebook's terms of service.'
